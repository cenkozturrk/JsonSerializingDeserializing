# Serialization and Deserialization Example

This repository contains a simple project that demonstrates the concepts of **serialization** and **deserialization** in .NET. Serialization is the process of converting an object into a format that can be stored or transmitted, while deserialization is the process of converting the stored or transmitted data back into an object.

## Features

- Demonstrates how to serialize objects into JSON and XML formats.
- Provides examples of deserializing JSON and XML back into objects.
- Uses `System.Text.Json` for JSON handling.
- Uses `System.Xml.Serialization` for XML handling.
